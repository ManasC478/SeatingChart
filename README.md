# Student Seating Chart Algorithm and Website

A collaboration between ManasC478 and Kefir101 to make a web-based seating chart algorithm for teachers to use to organize their classrooms based on 
their class layout, students, and those student's preferences like front/back of class, and students they want/don't want to sit next to.

This project uses Node for backend and React for frontend.

Project is still a Work In Progress, so keep checking on this repository for updates as we continue working on it.
